\title{
Identifies gene ontologies clustering samples according to predefined factor.
}
\description{
Combines local gene expression data with online Gene Ontology (GO) resources to identify ontologies 
enriched for genes best clustering predefined groups of samples based on expression levels.

The package will download Gene Ontologies from the Biomart database for the species
corresponding to the expression dataset prior to the analysis.
A one-way ANOVA is performed to evaluate the ability of each gene to cluster samples according 
to a predefined grouping factor. 
Each GO term is scored and ranked according to the average power of all related genes to
cluster the samples according to the factor of interest.
The ranked list of GO terms is returned, with tools allowing to visualise the statistics
of each gene and ontology.

\usage{
GO_anova(expr_data, phenodata, f, biomart_dataset="", microarray="",
                    adj.P.method = "BH", FDR=0.05)

# To force the use of the human ensembl BioMart, use:
# GO_anova(expr_data, phenodata, f, biomart_dataset = "hsapiens_gene_ensembl")

# To force use of the bovine affy_bovine microarray annotations use:
# GO_anova(expr_data, phenodata, f, microarray = "affy_bovine")
}
\arguments{
  \item{expr_data}{
Gene expression matrix. Row names are ensembl gene identifiers or probeset identifiers.
Column names are sample identifiers.
}
  \item{phenodata}{
An AnnotatedDataFrame. Row names are sample idenfifiers in the same order as those in
the expression dataset.
Column names are grouping factors and phenotypic traits usable for the one-way ANOVA.  
}
  \item{f}{
A value in colnames(phenodata) used as the grouping factor for the one-way ANOVA.
}
  \item{biomart_dataset}{
Optional. The BioMart ensembl dataset corresponding to the species studied.
Automatically detected if not specified.
}
  \item{microarray}{
Optional. The BioMart microarray column name in the dataset corresponding to the species studied.
Automatically detected if not specified.
}
  \item{adj.P.method}{
Optional. The multiple testing correction method used to correct the P values obtained in each ANOVA.
}
  \item{FDR}{
Optional. The threshold for significance. Default is 0.05.
