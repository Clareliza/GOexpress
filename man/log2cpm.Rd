\title{
Sample expression data from a RNAseq experiment.
}
\description{
A gene-by-sample matrix to test the package with. Data subset from an
\emph{in vitro} infection of bovine macrophages with different mycobacterial
strains. Column names are sample names, and row names are ensembl gene 
identifiers of the \emph{Bos taurus} species. Each cell contains the
log2-transformed normalised expression level of each gene in each sample.
}
\usage{data(log2cpm)}
\format{
A matrix of expression levels for 100 genes measured in 117 samples.

}
\details{
From the original dataset, all 7 genes associated with the GO term "GO:0034142"
corresponding to "toll-like receptor4 signaling pathway" were kept plus a
random 93 random genes, making a total of 100 genes measured in 117 samples.
Samples originate from 10 different animals and gene expression was measured at
4 different time-points, see \code{data(targets)}.
