Visualise microarray and RNAseq data with gene ontology annotations
  
# OVERVIEW

This package was designed for the analysis of bioinformatics
data based on gene expression measurements. It requires 3 input
values:

1. a sample-by-gene matrix providing the expression level
of genes (rows) in each sample (columns). Row names are expected to be
either ensembl gene identifiers or probeset identifiers present in the
BioMart database.
2. an AnnotatedDataFrame from the Biobase package providing phenotypic
information about the samples. Row names are samples, at least one of
the columns must be a grouping factor with two or more levels (factor
in the actual meaning of the R language).
3. the name of the grouping factor to investigate, which must be a
valid column name in the AnnotatedDataFrame.

The analysis identifies all Gene Ontology (GO) terms represented
in the BioMart dataset of the species studied. A one-way ANOVA is
performed on the grouping factor for each gene present in the
expression dataset. Following multiple-testing correction, genes
associated with the GO term in BioMart but below the threshold for
significance or absent from the dataset are assigned a F.value of 0.
GO terms are scored and ranked on the average F.value of associated
genes according to BioMart annotations.

Functions are provided to investigate and visualise the results of
the above analysis. The score table can be filtered for GO terms over
given thresholds. The distribution of scores can be visualised. The
quantiles of scores can be obtained. The genes associated with a
given GO term can be listed, with or without descriptive information.
Hierarchical clustering of the samples can be performed based on the
expression levels of genes associated with a given GO term. Heatmaps
accompanied by hierarchical clustering of samples and genes can be
drawn and customised. The expression profile of genes can be plotted
against any factor while grouping samples on another factor. The 
univariate effect of all factors can be visualised on the expression
levell of genes associated with a GO term.


# FEATURES

  * Support expression data based on ensembl gene identifiers and
probeset identifiers.

  * GO_analyse() scores all Gene Ontology (GO) terms represented in
the dataset based on the ability of their associated genes to cluster
samples according to a predefined grouping factor. It also returns
the table used to map genes to GO terms, the table summarising the
one-way ANOVA results for each gene, and finally the specified
grouping factor used for ANOVA. Genes annotated to a GO term but
absent from the expression dataset are ignored.

  * get_mart_dataset() returns a connection to the appropriate BioMart
dataset based on the gene name of the first gene in the expression
dataset. The choice of the dataset can be overriden by the user
if a valid BioMart ensembl dataset is specified.
  
  * subset_scores() filters output of GO_analyse() for GO terms passing
desired filters and returns a list formatted identically to the 
output of GO_analyse() with the filtered information.

  * hist_scores() plots the distribution of average F scores in the
output of GO_analyse() or subset_scores().

  * quantiles_scores() returns the quantile values corresponding
to defined percentiles.

  * list_genes() returns the list of ensembl gene identifiers
associated with a given GO term.

  * table_genes() returns a table of information about the ensembl
gene identifiers associated with  a given GO term.

  * cluster_GO() plots a hierarchical clustering of the samples
based on the expression levels of genes associated with a given
GO term.

  * heatmap_GO() plots a heatmap with hierarchical clustering of
the samples and genes based on the expression levels of genes
associated with a given GO term.

  * expression_plot() plots the expression profile of the gene
corresponding to an ensembl identifier, given valid variable name
for the X-axis and a grouping factor for the Y-axis.

  * expression_plot_symbol() plots the expression profile of the
gene(s) with the ensembl identifier(s) corresponding to a gene
symbol, given valid variable name for the X-axis and a grouping
factor for the Y-axis.

  * plot_design() plots the univariate effect of each level of each
factor available in the AnnotatedDataFrame on the expression levels
of genes associated with a GO term.
